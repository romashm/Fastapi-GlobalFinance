<p> When I started talk with my potential clien He doesnt like this behaviour & we decided that we makes it. a week passed, the customer brought what he needed, I finalized it and that's what happened. I canâ€™t show the whole mechanism that he described - itâ€™s confidential, but itâ€™s easy to catch my train of thought on the development of the project!</p>

<p> I decided to work with Fastapi systeam. I thought it was interesting then, and the opportunity to learn a new framework did not frighten me at all. I created <code> main.py </code> & with some basic structors beggin' work. I started to build the meaning of the pages and make them visualized to make it easier to understand what's what, while I stopped there. However, he soon continued and began to write each time under the code in the form of a TODO comment. It helped me not to forget what was happening and what I needed to add. For example, in the registration window, attach to postgresql.  </p>
